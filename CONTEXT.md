# OpenTerminal

A terminal-style financial dashboard: a Next.js frontend backed by an Express/SQLite API server that aggregates market data and provides an AI chat assistant.

## Language

**LLM Provider**:
A named backend for AI chat completion (`anthropic` or `ollama-cloud`), each with its own credentials, base URL, and default model.
_Avoid_: "Provider" alone — collides with the unrelated market-data providers in `server/src/providers/` (Binance, CoinGecko, Yahoo, Nasdaq, etc.), which are a different concept in a different domain.

**Active Provider**:
The single LLM Provider currently selected via the `LLM_PROVIDER` env var. Exactly one is active at a time — there is no fallback between providers and no runtime/UI selection.
_Avoid_: "Default provider" (ambiguous with the unset-env-var fallback to `anthropic`).

**Tool Call**:
A single model-invoked step within a chat turn's capped agentic loop (~4-5 per turn), where the AI assistant calls a registered tool (e.g. news search) and gets a result back before continuing. Works identically under either Active Provider via the shared `tools` field on `LlmChatRequest`. Positions and Watchlist are auto-injected as plain context each turn and are not Tool Calls.

**Pending Action**:
An AI-proposed ledger write (adding, editing, or deleting a Transaction) that is held for human review rather than applied directly. The user can edit any field before confirming, or reject it outright; nothing is written to `transactions` until confirmed. Multiple Pending Actions can be open at once, and none auto-expire.

**Memory Entry**:
A distilled, AI-authored note that the assistant saves on its own to recall in later chat turns, tagged with an optional symbol and category. Raw tool output (fetched articles, quote dumps) is never saved as a Memory Entry — only the model's own summarized notes are. The user can delete a Memory Entry but cannot edit one in place.

**Audit Log Entry**:
An append-only record of one unit of AI activity — a full chat transcript, a Tool Call, a Pending Action lifecycle event, or a Memory Entry write — plus call metadata and failures. Audit Log Entries have no update or delete path, including for the user, and are retained forever.
